                  Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing
                  cocoa, sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of
                  chocolate. Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a
                  beverage in pre-Columbian times. Although four-fifths of all
                  milk chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe,
                  increasingly large amounts are consumed in China and Latin
                  America.

                  Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of
                  mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young
                  mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are
                  able to digest solid food.Early-lactation milk, which is
                  called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the
                  immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases.
                  Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.

                  chocolate is to compare it to a different type of chocolate.
                  Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste
                  comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste whereas milk
                  chocolate is sweeter and more mellow. This delectable flavor
                  of chocolate is very versatile.
